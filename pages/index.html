					<span class="harticle">Crystal Curse</span>: His memory graces us with another stunning screenshot from <em>Dark Souls</em>. The curvature of the ground makes it seem like he's standing on a crystalline world.

					<span class="harticle">Head South</span>: This guy looks into his compass as the sky opens up to shine light on a fading world. He might be low on blood, but in <em>DayZ</em>, that's just part of life.

						<span class="harticle">Raceway</span>: <em>Codemasters</em> has made some great-looking, playing, and sounding games. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/k_putt/">K-putt</a> seems to agree as this amazing screenshot shows. The cloudy sky and spectators act as an appropriate backdrop to the rally car and it all makes you feel like you're actually there.</article>
					<article class="m-l">
						<span class="harticle">Alan Wake's American Nightmare</span> isn't usually what we'd describe as graphics photorealism, but this particular shot is drop-dead gorgeous. Story might be the game's main selling point, but clearly, it's got the looks as well as the brains. Thanks again to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/k_putt/">K-putt</a>.
